5.3.2. Output File Formats
Wireshark can save the packet data in its native file format (pcapng) and in the file formats of other protocol analyzers so other tools can read the capture data.

[Note]	Saving in a different format might lose data
Saving your file in a different format might lose information such as comments, name resolution, and time stamp resolution. See Section 7.6, “Time Stamps” for more information on time stamps.

The following file formats can be saved by Wireshark (with the known file extensions):

pcapng (*.pcapng). A flexible, extensible successor to the libpcap format. Wireshark 1.8 and later save files as pcapng by default. Versions prior to 1.8 used libpcap.
pcap (*.pcap). The default format used by the libpcap packet capture library. Used by tcpdump, _Snort, Nmap, Ntop, and many other tools.
