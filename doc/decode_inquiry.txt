
When a controller starts inquiry, nearby controllers will answer with their MAC addr.
The HCI inquiry command is a longrunning process.
The controller will therefore send a command status event to the host to inform
the host if the command could be started or not.
One possible outcome is that the host has requested parameters that the controller
cannot support. In this case a status command request with a error_code of 0x12
"Invalid HCI Command Parameters" is returned by the controller.
If the command could be started an error_code of 0x00 is returned, which denotes
success.
