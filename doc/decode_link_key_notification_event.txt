7.7.24  Link Key Notification Event

Description: 

The Link Key Notification event is used to indicate to the Host that a new Link 
Key has been created for the connection with the device specified in 
BD_ADDR. The Host can save this new Link Key in its own storage for future 
use. Also, the Host can decided to store the Link Key in the BR/EDR Control-
lerâ€™s Link Key Storage by using the Write_Stored_Link_Key command. The 
Key_Type event parameter informs the Host about which key type (combina-
tion key, local unit key, or remote unit key, debug combination key, unauthenti-
cated combination key, authenticated combination key or changed combination 
key) that was used during pairing. If pairing with unit key is not supported, the 
Host can for instance discard the key or disconnect the link.

The combination key Key_Type is used when standard pairing was used. The 
debug combination key Key_Type is used when Simple Pairing was used and 
the debug public key is sent or received. The unauthenticated combination key 
Key_Type is used when the Just Works Simple Pairing association model was 
used. The authenticated combination key Key_Type is used when Simple Pair-
ing was used and the Just Works association mode was not used. The 
changed combination key Key_Type is used when the link key has been 
changed using the Change Connection Link Key procedure and Simple Pairing 
Mode is set to enabled. Note: It is the responsibility of the Host to remember 
the Key_Type (combination, debug combination, unauthenticated combination, 
or authenticated combination) prior to changing the link key.
