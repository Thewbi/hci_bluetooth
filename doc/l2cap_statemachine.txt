Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol Specification
6  STATE MACHINE
This section is informative. The state machine may not represent all possible 
scenarios. 

6.1   GENERAL RULES FOR THE STATE MACHINE:
• It is implementation specific, and outside the scope of this specification, how 
the transmissions are triggered. 
• “Ignore” means that the signal can be silently discarded.
The following states have been defined to clarify the protocol; the actual num-
ber of states and naming in a given implementation is outside the scope of this 
specification:
• CLOSED – channel not connected.
• WAIT_CONNECT – a connection request has been received, but only a 
connection response with indication “pending” can be sent.
• WAIT_CONNECT_RSP – a connection request has been sent, pending a 
positive connect response.
• CONFIG – the different options are being negotiated for both sides; this 
state comprises a number of substates, see Section 6.1.3 on page 102
• OPEN – user data transfer state.
• WAIT_DISCONNECT – a disconnect request has been sent, pending a dis-
connect response.
• WAIT_CREATE – a channel creation request has been received, but only a 
response with indication “pending” can be sent. This state is similar to 
WAIT_CONNECT.
• WAIT_CREATE_RSP – a channel creation request has been sent, pending 
a channel creation response. This state is similar to WAIT_CONNECT_RSP.
• WAIT_MOVE – a request to move the current channel to another Controller 
has been received, but only a response with indication “pending” can be 
sent.
• WAIT_MOVE_RSP – a request to move a channel to another Controller has 
been sent, pending a move response
• WAIT_MOVE_CONFIRM – a response to the move channel request has 
been sent, waiting for a confirmation of the move operation by the initiator 
side
• WAIT_CONFIRM_RSP – a move channel confirm has been sent, waiting for 
a move channel confirm response.
